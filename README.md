This was my first ever personal project, my introduction to the Godot Game Engine, and the origin of my love for game development

This is a Flappy-like Typing Game. Rather than just single inputs, you must type quotes from my friend Jose to make him fly.

I originally was making a straight Flappy Bird clone to learn the engine, and then I was struck with inspiration to turn it into a typing game. I got assistance from my friend Jose, as he is the face of the game, the voice actor (as himself), and the originator of the quotes in the game
